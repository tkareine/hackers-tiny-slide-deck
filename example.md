# Hacker's Tiny Slide Deck

## (Or HTSD in short)

### A feature demonstration

Press ➡️ (right arrow) or swipe left to go to the next slide.

## Keyboard shortcuts

⬅️ (left arrow) or _swipe right gesture_ to show the previous slide

➡️ (right arrow) or _swipe left gesture_ to show the next slide

`Home` to show the first slide

`End` to show the last slide

`Shift+F` to toggle fullscreen

## Code snippet

An implementation in JavaScript to calculate the [Fibonacci number], to
demonstrate syntax highlighting with [Prism.js]:

``` javascript
/* iterative implementation */
function fibonacci(n) {
  let a = 1
  let b = 0
  let temp

  while (n >= 0) {
    temp = a
    a = a + b
    b = temp
    n -= 1
  }

  return b
}
```

(You might have to scroll to reach here, and that's intentional.)

## Usage

1. Prepare a Markdown document, like the [example][example.md]
   you're looking at currently. Separate content between intended slides
   with `---` (three dashes, these become as `<hr>` tags in the html
   conversion).

2. Append a `<script>` tag linking the HTSD JavaScript bundle to the end
   of the Markdown document.

3. Turn the Markdown document into html using a general-purpose
   markdown-to-html converter (such as [marked]).

---

## How it works

The `<script>` tag makes the browser to load the HTSD JavaScript bundle,
which transforms the html document into a slideshow. The transformation
happens in-browser, with these steps:

1. The script injects an inline CSS `<style>` tag into the `<head>` of
   the document. The styles are used to display `<div
   class="htsd-slide">` tags (created next) as slides.

2. The script looks for `<hr>` tags that are direct childs of the
   `<body>` tag, and wraps the contents between the `<hr>`s into `<div
   class="htsd-slide">` tags.

3. Then, the script installs keyboard shortcuts, gestures, and
   `document.location.hash` handling for navigation.

## Styling customization

There's a selection of [CSS custom properties] (variables) that affect
slide looks globally.

For example, set the font family for your slide deck:

``` css
:root {
  --htsd-sans-font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
  --htsd-mono-font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;
}
```

---

## Styling customization, code snippets

Highlight code with [Prism.js] by appending the following line to the
end of the Markdown document (as in the [example][example.md] you're
looking at):

``` html
<script type="text/javascript"
        src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.17.1/prism.min.js">
</script>
```

Use the following CSS selector to tune the font-size in the code snippet
above smaller:

``` css
/* select the html code block in the 7th slide */
.htsd-slide:nth-of-type(7) pre code.language-html {
  font-size: 0.6rem;
}
```

---

## Other customizations

See the bottom of the [Markdown source][example.md] of this slide deck
and the [README].

Being tiny, you can easily hack the implementation for your own needs!
